# Deep_Fake_Image_Classification
## Introduction
Deep fake images have become a growing concern in today's digital age. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify real and fake images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to detect manipulations in images and distinguish between authentic and altered content.

## Features
- Binary Classification: Classifies images as either real or fake.
- Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the VGG16 model to improve performance.
- Transfer Learning: Adds custom layers to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the dataset.
